## About
The SSL Website is a platform designed to showcase members of the SSL community, providing details about each member.
The site highlights important information about SSL members and allows for easy updates.

## How to Update The Site

## How to Update The Site Without the Tool

To manually update the SSL Website, follow these steps:

1. **Access the HTML File**: Open the main HTML file for the SSL Website in a text editor (such as VS Code, Sublime Text, or even Notepad).

2. **Locate Member Section**: Find the section in the HTML where member details are listed. This may be organized in a specific section, div, or table, depending on the structure.

3. **Edit Member Information**: 
   - **Add New Members**: Copy the structure of an existing member entry and paste it in the appropriate place. Update the details with the new member’s information.
   - **Update Existing Members**: Locate the member's entry you need to update and modify the relevant details directly in the HTML.

4. **Save and Deploy**: Save your changes, then upload the updated HTML file to your hosting platform or web server.

5. **Verify Changes**: Open the SSL Website in a browser to ensure that the changes appear correctly.

This manual method is useful for small edits or quick changes when you don’t have access to the Python tool.



## If the tool works

To update the SSL Website, follow these steps:

1. **Modify Member Information**: Update member details by editing the Python script, `SSL_members.py`, where new members can be added or existing details can be changed.

2. **Run the Script**: Execute the Python script to regenerate the HTML output with the updated member information. Ensure all new or edited details are accurate before running.

3. **Deploy Updated HTML**: Once the HTML is updated, deploy it to the web server or hosting platform being used for the SSL Website.

4. **Verify Changes**: After deployment, visit the SSL Website to confirm that all changes are displayed correctly.

Ensure that all updates follow the existing format and do not include icons or images for LinkedIn, GitHub, or email, in line with the project’s specifications.
